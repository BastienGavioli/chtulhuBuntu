    <h2>Great website really well made</h2>
        <div><p>The first junk founded by a surfer date back to first May 1776.
                Every year, 141965456X pieces of rubbish are found in the ocean and on the shoreline.
                To help with that, we decided to give you the ability to bring change through this website.
                You can now report small and large quantities of rubbish that you find during your surfing sessions!
                To do that, you will only have to go on the dedicated page (<a href="index.php?controller=dechet&action=choixDechet&lang=EN">here</a>), and file your report!
                If you wish to not miss any news, if you are interested in ecology or worshipping our god and saviour CthulhUbuntu
                or simply because you often have the opportuity to spot rubbish, you can register on the page mentioned before!
                To be ready for your next outing, check out our weather page (<a href="index.php?controller=meteo&action=read&lang=EN">here</a>)!
                Made to make your life easier, it will prevent you from going out on a rainy day or let you know to prepare enough sunscreen!
